#' However, presence of additional rooms implies different infrastructure 
#' which must change for houses with same tfarea but a difference in number of rooms
#' 
#' Also the type of building interacts with tfarea since spaces are organised 
#' differently and houses which are allowed to have storeys for sure will have
#' different prices in the market than flats even at the same area coverage
